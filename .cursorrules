# Cursor Rules for Congenial Dollop Game

## CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE

### 1. NO LOGGING IN UPDATE METHODS - HARD RULE
- **NEVER** add console.log, console.error, or any logging in update() methods
- **NEVER** add logging in methods called by update() (like updateAdminUI, updateLevelInfo, etc.)
- Update methods run 60 times per second - logging here creates spam
- Only log in event handlers, initialization, or one-time operations

### 2. PERFORMANCE RULES
- Update methods must be lightweight and fast
- No expensive calculations in update loops
- Cache values when possible
- Use frame-based throttling for expensive operations

### 3. PHASER OBJECT LIFECYCLE
- Always check if objects are active and have scenes before accessing
- Clean up intervals, timers, and event listeners properly
- Handle object destruction gracefully

### 4. CODE QUALITY
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Add proper error handling
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Document complex logic

### 5. GAME ARCHITECTURE
- Keep level cache system healthy
- Ensure smooth level transitions
- Maintain admin UI functionality
- Preserve game state consistency

### 6. MINIMAL CHANGES RULE
- **ONLY** do exactly what is asked for
- **NEVER** add extra features, improvements, or changes beyond the specific request
- **NEVER** refactor code unless explicitly requested
- **NEVER** add additional functionality beyond the minimum requirement

## ENFORCEMENT
- These rules are MANDATORY
- Violations will be corrected immediately
- Focus on stability and performance
- Prioritize user experience over debug convenience
